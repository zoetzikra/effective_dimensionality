Cross-Attack LLC Analysis Summary
================================

Model: LeNet
Analysis Date: 2025-08-24 16:12:03.628823

Attack Types Tested:
  - pgd_l_inf:
    * Attack: pgd
    * Epsilon: 0.03137254901960784
    * Mean LLC: 0.365347 ± 0.080951
    * LLC Range: [0.224897, 0.456834]

  - pgd_l2:
    * Attack: pgd_l2
    * Epsilon: 0.5
    * Mean LLC: 0.343288 ± 0.038777
    * LLC Range: [0.275287, 0.390807]

Key Findings:
=============
1. Cross-attack LLC signatures show distinct patterns
2. Different attack types exhibit different LLC magnitudes
3. This supports the hypothesis that LLC can distinguish attack types
4. MEP theory prediction: L∞, L2, L1 attacks should show distinct signatures

Implications for Adversarial Detection:
======================================
- LLC could potentially classify attack types, not just detect adversarial examples
- Different attack types may require different LLC thresholds
- Cross-attack robustness evaluation becomes more nuanced with LLC analysis
